    Content: "\"In Deum\" is a Latin phrase which means \"on the way to God\" or \"towards God\". This is taken from the famous Augustinian dictum \"ANIMA UNA ET COR UNUM IN DEUM\" translated as \"ONE MIND and ONE HEART on the way to GOD\". This expression manifests our collective awareness that in everything we do, we offer it in the name and for the glory of God. By greeting each other \"In Deum\", we wish to recognize in ourselves God's infinite and sustaining generosity as we journey back to Him.",
